# My Test Driven Development Repository

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

I am glad to share a few of my works in TDD through this repository. Each task or project is placed in its own folder.  Each folder contains all the necessary files to run a particular project.

These are the steps to run the test:
* Download the folder you want to test and open it with Visual Studio Code.
* Open a terminal panel from `View` menu and select `Terminal`. Make sure its default shell is `bash.exe`.
* To run the test type this command: `npm test` in the terminal panel and press Enter.

Cheers!
