# My Test Driven Development Repository

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

I am glad to share a few of my works in TDD through this repository. Each task or project is placed in its folder.  Each folder contains all the necessary files to run a particular project.

These are the steps to run the test:
* download the folder you want to test
* open it with VSCode
* open the terminal panel. make sure its default shell is bash.exe
* to run the test type this command: `npm test` in the terminal panel and press Enter.
